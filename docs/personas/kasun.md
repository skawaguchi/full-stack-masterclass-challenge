# Kasun

Kasun is a 42-year-old who works for the city of Mississauga. He immigrated to Canada in 1992 and proud of his adopted country. Part of his loyalty is his love of all things Canadian, and he considers Beau's and Mill St. (until they were sold) the epitome of Ontarian small brewery excellence. At first, when he would be drinking at regular social family gatherings, his family made fun of him eschewing Beau's and Mill St. for Kingfisher. However, after a few time of trying Beau's and Mill St. Organic, his family started to prefer Ontarian beers. Now, trying new things and Ontario breweries are a thing with Kasun's family, and they constantly are trying and discussing the most recent Beau's selections. Kasun also likes to his his colleagues at summer BBQs, and they have all come to love Beau's seasonal selections as well. In fact, it was Kasun's best friend from work, Anthony, who introduced him to Beau's in the first place.
