# Kate & Fernando

Kate is a 24-year-old living in Ottawa. She did not drink until she started working for a marketing agency in the past couple of years and she only does so recreationally. She has tried various Beau's beverages because her boyfriend, Fernando, is a fan. He is an EMT, which is fairly stressful so he likes to unwind with a nice craft beer after a tough shift. Kate is almost indifferent, but really enjoys trying new things. So after the Autumn Taster package she took sips from this past Fall season, she checks out the selection of Beau's Seasonal Beverages every time she and Fernando and getting together with their friends. Being young professionals in a large city, they see friends a couple of times a week. Fernando and Kate also enjoy splitting new seasonal beers over dinner so that they can try out the various options. Both are curious people and like to try new things.
