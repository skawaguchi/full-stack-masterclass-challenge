# Joey

Joey is a 29-year-old living in downtown Toronto. He's the "beer connoisseur" of his group of friends, and enjoys spending his time learning about local craft breweries. One of his favorites is Beau's, and he is constantly checking in to see what the current seasonal selections are so that he can give great advice to his friends on what to try next. He also likes to stock his fridge with various beers to try with his friends when they have get-togethers.
