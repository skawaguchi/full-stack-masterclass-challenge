# Fred & Tommy

Fred is a 57-year-old aeronautics engineer who consults for De Havilland, and whose hobby is building airplanes in his repurposed barn in the rural parts near London, Ontario. He has been a huge fan of Beau's since it opened in 2006 and mostly sticks to Lug Tread. His love of Beau's is mostly based on the fact that it's a Canadian brewery and "local", and that it's a great craft beer. Even though he's a "loyal Lug Tread Man" as he puts it, he keeps around seasonal beers for his 23-year-old son, Tommy, who enjoys drinking beer after tinkering with his dad on planes. He doesn't enjoy Lug Tread, but likes to drink Beau's because it's got cachet with his university friends and because his dad is so partial to the brand. Tommy is taking mechanical engineering at Western University and considering following in his dad's footsteps. Either way, their love of airplanes and beer gives them a common ground.
