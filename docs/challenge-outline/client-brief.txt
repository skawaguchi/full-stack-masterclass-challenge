Client Brief: Beau’s has hired you to create an application that highlights their seasonal beverages. Their most well-known brand is Lug Tread, which is not a seasonal beer, so they want to exclude Lug Tread from the application.

Beau’s wants you to display all of the beers that are available through the LCBO. When a user selects one, they want you to provide a description and also show the stores that carry that particular beer. If you have time, also provide a feature that allows the user to get directions to the store they select.

Use the provided style guide.
