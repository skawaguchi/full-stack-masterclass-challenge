## Client App
To work with the client app, which was built with `create-react-app`, then you need to `cd` into `./src/client` and use the commands in that particular `package.json` -> `scripts`.

# Tests

## Run Node 8.9.3+
Run `nvm use` when you start the project. It's set up to work with the latest version of Node. If you're not using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you should strongly consider it. It makes moving between Node versions simple.

## ESLint
Run `yarn eslint`

## StyleLint
Run `yarn stylelint`

## Unit Tests
